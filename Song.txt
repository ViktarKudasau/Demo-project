I wanna be loved by you, just you,
Nobody else but you,
I wanna be loved by you, alone,
Poo poo bee doo,

I wanna be kissed by you, just you,
Nobody else but you,
I wanna be kissed by you, alone

I couldn't aspire
To anything higher,
Than to feel the desire
To make you my own
Paah-dum paah-dum pa-doodly-dum poooo!

I wanna be loved by you, just you,
Nobody else but you,
I wanna be loved by you, alone
